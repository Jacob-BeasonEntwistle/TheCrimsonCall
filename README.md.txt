The Crimson Call

This repository is for the final submission of my 3D Game Programming and Game Asset Pipeline modules.

Story
You are a knight that awoke in the middle of a forest. The only thing around is an ancient ruin that holds in the center a silver wand-like object with a blue glow. You pick up this wand and are flooded with some strange power that remains dormant until you use the wand. A path leads to a nearby village and the gate opens for you with the same blue glow as the wand. Within the village walls lies a bright red box which makes you ask yourself questions.

Why does it seem so familiar yet so out of place?
Why does it react to the wand?
What is its connection to the village?

Play to find out!
